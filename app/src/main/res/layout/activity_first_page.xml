What is a Forklift Checklist?
A forklift checklist is a tool used by forklift operators to ensure that powered industrial trucks are in good working condition before use. Forklift checklists are used in conducting safety inspections and maintenance checks to reduce the likelihood of avoidable injuries and deaths caused by faulty forklifts in warehouses, factories, shipping yards, and other workplaces.

Also known as forklift drivers, forklift operators drive industrial trucks and specialize in warehouse transportation. Their primary responsibilities include loading and unloading warehouse material, optimizing loads to ensure operational efficiency and identifying damages to vehicles.
